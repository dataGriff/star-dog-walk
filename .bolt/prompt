Design a mobile-first web app for dog owners in Cardiff's Splott & Adamsdown to connect with a local dog walker. Key features: walk scheduling, pet profiles, walk journals with photos and messages, and in-app communication. Core pages: schedule walk, pet profiles, walk updates. Business goal: 30% growth in bookings in 3 months, enhance local search visibility, reduce admin tasks. Exclude payment handling and analytics. Target only Splott & Adamsdown areas.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
